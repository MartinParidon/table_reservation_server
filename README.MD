# Seat Reservation Server

## Getting Started

### Set-up
You need to pull this repo.
Also, need to install python (e.g. a virtual environment within this folder) and then install the requirements like this:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage (second largest heading)
This is a flask website. You can run a local server to test and adapt it to your liking. Please keep in mind that there is no security measure implemented. If you run an informal (internal) server, this might be enough, but be careful when you handle sensitive data. I'm taking no responsibility for that.
